# WebdriverIO project

For this project we will be testing the Urban Routes web app.
Javascript, Node.js, and Webdriver io will be used in this project. Javascript will be the language used to write our tests, and will be used in conjunction with Webdriver io and Node. Webdriver io is a browser and mobile automation testing framework for Node. Node will be used as our Javascript runtime environment as well as our package manager.

Code style used in this project is camelCase, each test having a descriptive title, and comments are provided for each test to explain what the respective test does.

page.js is our page object file that contains our sets of selectors and functions that will be used to run our tests.

helper.js contains some extra functions that will help with some tasks needed to run our tests.
